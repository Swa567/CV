## Sarah Dousse

I’m a creative thinker and future junior software developer, opening communication through illustrations and my newly acquired coding skills. I use my drawings to engage the emotions and code to connect with people. I am looking for impactful projects where my artistic mind and desire to learn can make a difference.

Some people say I am a dreamer, but I am more of an out of the box thinker. Looking at a problem from a different perspective helps me come up with unusual solutions. The most unusual one so far was that once I realised my job as a freelance illustrator wasn’t satisfying anymore, I started learning to code. First, just by myself, studiously following online courses, then I discovered pair-programming, and I was captivated. It is such a great way to learn and an excellent way to meet new people.
After a few months of coding, I’ve learnt that I shouldn’t be afraid to fail as it is just part of the process. And yes, for an artist with a bit of imposter syndrome, this was a huge step.

Now I introduce myself as an aspiring junior developer who likes to doodle as a hobby. I will be joining the November cohort at Makers Academy, an intense software development bootcamp in London.
