## Sarah Dousse

I'm a junior software developer and creative thinker, opening communication through my newly acquired coding skills. I code to connect with people, and I'm looking for impactful projects where my artistic mind and desire to learn can make a difference.

I am currently consolidating my Ruby/Rails/Javascript and learning Golang and Python for my personal projects, so I'll share them when I've built something new!

**Illustrator / Visualiser** (August 2014 to March 2017)  
_Geometry Global (WPP)_

I've worked for advertising companies for nearly three years at Geometry (part of WPP), delivering high-quality visuals and artwork.

During the visualisation process, I can lead by proposing simple solutions to improve the visual impact of the Art Directors' scamps.

I also acquired experience in storyboarding, packaging and brand design (icons), and I have worked on a wide range of clients.

## Skills

Over the four months at Makers, I faced quite a handful of challenges, from debugging my own or someone else's code, setting up a project from scratch, choosing a library, to finding the right resources. All this was and still is very new to me, but thank's to my previous work experience as an Illustrator / Art director (in-house and freelance), I have carved out a few skills that help me get through the Bootcamp and get the best of start for my career in software development.

**Knack for solving problems:** <br />
As a freelancer, I developed a sharp eye to spot upcoming problems before they happen. Usually, it had to do with tight deadlines and a not so elastic budget. But my goal was to deliver the best quality within the limit of a project. It usually comes to decide what is 'essential' and 'nice to implement at some point'.
I take particular care in planning my coding projects. It can be a neat miro when working in groups to a doodle if it's a personal project, but it helps me narrow down the future edge cases, keep a clear head and break down my tasks into smaller tasks.

**Learning new skills to fit a project best:** <br />
I'd love it when a client would trust me to create something special for their project even though the style they were looking for wasn't in my portfolio. That part of the exploration at the beginning of the project is my favourite.

**Thoughtful and Mindful:** <br />
As a team player, I know that everyone is happy with their part and have a good overview of the project. I believe there is no concern too small for a quick catch up. At Makers, we learnt to run stand-up and retrospectives and develop an agile workflow. This helped our communication within the team and helped us reach our 'stretched goals' tasks in the end.
