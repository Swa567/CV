# Sarah Dousse


I've graduated from Makers in mid-February 2022, and I'm looking for impactful projects where my artistic mind and desire to learn can make a difference.

I have eight years of work experience as an Illustrator / Art director (in-house and freelance). Through this and my education at Makers, I have carved out a few skills that will help start my career in software development.

I'm currently learning Go and extending my knowledge of Ruby/Rails.

## Skills

**Knack for solving problems:** <br />
As a freelancer, I developed a sharp eye to spot upcoming problems before they happen. Usually, it had to do with tight deadlines and a not so elastic budget. But my goal was to deliver the best quality within the limit of a project. It usually comes to decide what is 'essential' and 'nice to implement at some point'.
I take particular care in planning my coding projects. It can be a neat miro when working in groups to a doodle if it's a personal project, but it helps me narrow down the future edge cases, keep a clear head and break down my tasks into smaller tasks.

**Self-learner & autonomous worker:** <br />
During the Bootcamp, I wasn't reaching my weekly goals. The week about database was hefty, so I took the Christmas break to redo the week's challenge by myself and some of the consolidation workshops. I like to work in a fast-paced environment, but I know when to slow down to consolidate my knowledge before moving forward. After this, the rest of the Bootcamp was still challenging but not overwhelming.

I spend a lot of my free time self-learning, and when I am at a crossroads, I like to seek advice from my team and peers on what I need to learn or improve.
Pair programming got me into software development, I trained for Makers with alumni, and we paired almost every day during the Bootcamp.

**Project direction:** <br />
I take particular care in planning my coding projects. It can be a neat miro when working in groups to a scribble if it's a personal project, but it helps keep a clear head and break down my items into smaller tasks. I took the habit of documenting my projects with snippets in the readmes with a few screenshots and tidy diagrams. I hope this will help my peers dive into my projects and create exciting conversations.

**Manage expectations:** <br />
When working with Dogs Trust, I came up with a system of mixing & matching bodies and heads when illustrating different dog behaviours. This helped us save on time and budget without lowering the quality standards. Thanks to this approach, we collaborated several times over the years.

**Thoughtful and Mindful:** <br />
As a team player, I like to make sure that everyone is happy and has a good overview of the project. I believe there is no concern too small for a quick catch up. At Makers, we learnt to run stand-up and retrospectives and develop an agile workflow. This helped our communication within the team and helped us reach our 'stretched goals' in the end.
